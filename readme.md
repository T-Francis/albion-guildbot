Forked to learn & experiencing discord bots development and usage, all the modification was made for my personal convenience

# Configuration

You **MUST** setup a `config.js` file, an example may be found at [`app/config.js.dist`](./app/config.js.dist)

# Usage

It can be use as a traditional node app and with your own build & runtime

```
cd app/ && npm install && npm run start
```

OR

you may go with the docker style and just go for

```
docker-compose up -d
```
